Executive Summary – Frewen Reserve Token ($FRWN)
Frewen Reserve (FRWN) is a digitally tokenized asset representing secured economic rights linked to an ultra-rare, appraised imperial jade collection, vaulted at Asprey London with a verified SKR. Issued on the Ethereum blockchain and currently deployed on Sepolia for demonstration, FRWN serves as the foundation of a broader asset-backed digital finance strategy.

This token is not a fractional ownership vehicle. Instead, FRWN represents participation in a tokenized structure backed by real-world value with a framework that allows for engagement in lending, trade finance, or asset leverage without the need to liquidate or subdivide the underlying asset.

Key Highlights
Asset-Backed Token: $FRWN is underpinned by a physical jadeite collection appraised at over $1.1 billion and secured with formal documentation and vaulting.

Verified Smart Contract: The FrewenReserve2 smart contract is verified on the Sepolia testnet, with publicly viewable source code and ABI.

Fixed Supply: 1,000,000 tokens minted at deployment, with no minting function exposed to prevent inflation.

Legal Structure: Rights and responsibilities are governed through a formal Token Participation Agreement, outlining participant terms and risk factors.

Use Case Flexibility: FRWN can serve as collateral in off-chain deals, structured lending, or tokenized financial products — with future migration planned for mainnet once institutional pathways are confirmed.

Transparency: All documentation, including whitepapers, agreements, and disclosures, is available via GitHub and associated repositories.
